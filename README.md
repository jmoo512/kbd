This app was designed to track and visualize sales growth and key metrics results through charts. It was intended for use internally by a now bought out company. Though it was never completely or used, certain details have been altered to avoid identification of the company.

# Technologies
Front end: Vanilla JavaScript used to navigate pages, fetch data for selected locations, and prepare data for chart creation. Charts created using plotly.

Back end: Python and Flask used to create API endpoints for each data fetch. Data wrangled using Pandas.
